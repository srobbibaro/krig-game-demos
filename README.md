========================

Krig is an open source game engine created to run on the Linux operating system.

For more information, see: https://github.com/srobbibaro/krig-game-engine

This repository contains demo games which run on the Krig Game Engine.

## Getting Started

At this time, Krig is known to run on 32-bit Debian-based Linux
distributions running GNOME. Other distributions and configurations should work,
but have not been verified.

### Setup

You must have a Krig Game Engine executable for your platform to run these demos.

For more information, see: https://github.com/srobbibaro/krig-game-engine

### Run

Launch the Krig Game Engine from the command line. You must supply the path to the game to run as the first argument.

For example, to launch the `boats` demo, run:

```bash
$ ./krig boats
```
