Krig Game Engine - Demos
========================

Krig is a cross-platform, open source game engine.

For more information, see: https://github.com/srobbibaro/krig-game-engine

This repository contains demo games which run on the Krig Game Engine.

## Getting Started

At this time, Krig is known to build and run on a number of *nix operating systems.

The following configurations are known to work:
* 32/64-bit Debian-based Linux distributions with GNOME or XFCE (native)
* 32-bit Debian-based Linux distributions with GNOME or XFCE (VM with hardware acceleration)
* 64-bit Debian-based Linux distributions with GNOME or XFCE (VM without hardware acceleration)
* Mac OSX Yosemite and El Capitan

Other distributions and configurations should work, but have not been verified.

### Setup

You must have a Krig Game Engine executable for your platform to run these demos.

For more information, see: https://github.com/srobbibaro/krig-game-engine

### Run

Launch the Krig Game Engine from the command line. You must supply the path to the game to run as the first argument.

For example, to launch the `boats` demo, run:

```bash
$ ./krig boats
```
